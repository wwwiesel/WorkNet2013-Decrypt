## WorkNet2013 Decryptor

This tool allows you to decrypt weakly obfuscated passwords stored in the WorkNet2013 database.  
The application uses a static character substitution method to recover the original plaintext credentials.

🔍 **Purpose**  
WorkNet2013 stores user passwords in a non-secure, reversible format using basic substitution.  
This script demonstrates how such obfuscation mechanisms can be reversed easily and should *not* be considered secure.
